*A view of a grow-out pen* 

My college operates a small hog farm in southern Missouri. However, we are anything but typical. We have anywhere from 20-30 sows at a given time, but the catch is that our pigs are kept on pasture. Pasture pigs is a concept often considered outdated or not practical for the real world. Nevertheless, pasture raised pork is regaining some of its popularity, especially as a specialty product in niche markets. Our operation focuses on learning, and as a result, we employ various concepts throughout the farm to teach and challenge the students. We do face limitations that prevent us from experiencing all aspects of the commercial hog industry, but the skills learned can be easily transferred and built upon.

With this writing experience, I am going to provide you, the reader, with a sense of what I do every day with my given level of exposure to hogs. My primary focus is my daily activities of working at the hog farm through my college and contributing some of my knowledge that I gained from working at a commercial facility. I will describe our selection criteria for pigs, maintaining animal health and welfare, as well as housing and containment in a pasture setting. Every day on the farm is different, but the main objectives are consistent. My goal is to share some of my passion for the industry. Raising hogs is not an easy or glorious job; it is dirty, time-consuming, smelly, and loud. However, it is also highly rewarding. Pigs are extremely intelligent creatures, and each one has a distinct personality that is seen over time. This brings many challenges to the farmer, but by overcoming and accepting the difficulties, the farmer gains pride in what he or she does.

This blog is intended for anyone who has any interest in raising hogs. I can provide some groundwork concepts for those just starting out. This blog can also be used to introduce novel ideas for farmers who currently have hogs and want to try a different avenue. I cannot be fully inclusive or explain every aspect of the concepts of the hog industry. I can only explain what I know and what works for our operation. My hope is that the ideas and practices I discuss will fill you with interest into further research and will provide some new ideas to consider for your operation. The hog industry is diverse and thriving, and the little man is still able to contribute without over-extending resources. I want to demonstrate that the industry is approachable and accessible for all sizes of production. If not this, then I hope it is at least entertaining and brings awareness to agriculture and the passion that farmers possess.

## Choose the Right Pigs

Selecting the right pigs for any operation is not an easy task. Opinions fluctuate depending on the operation and the current concept of the ideal animal. Different types of pigs are better suited for diverse types of scenarios from commercial production type hogs, to heritage breeds, and even into the show pig sector. Both visual appraisal and written performance should be considered. The animal may look good, but do the numbers match up? 

There are multiple examples of a breeder buying a phenomenal looking boar or gilt. But when they get home, the pig will not breed. Therefore, a lot of money is wasted on an animal that is sent to the slaughterhouse. It can also go the other way around, the pig may look great on paper with a respectable pedigree but may be physically unable to perform, such as lameness, or blind, etc.  

On the farm at CofO, we have several different breeds of hogs. Each breed brings something new to the table. The farm was founded with a Hampshire herd and has expanded to include Berkshires, Yorkshires, cross-bred blue butts, and commercial lines. 

The Berkshires and Hampshires are used to improve meat quality. These varieties are popular as heritage breeds because they fatten out well, and the Berkshires produce high quality bacon. We value this because the market hogs are sent to the processing plant on campus where the pork is served at The Keeter Center, our restaurant on campus.

The Yorkshires and commercial sows are used to improve litter size. These breeds are maternally based, meaning that on average they have more pigs per litter. We breed the maternal or white sows to a Berkshire or Hampshire boar that we keep. This cross-breeding generates better meat quality in the pigs that are farrowed from the white sows.

Since our pigs run on dirt, I emphasize the structure of our breeding stock to ensure longevity. Correct composition of feet and legs is important, so the sows will be able to function on pasture where they do a lot of walking to graze, go to water, and come up to feed. The sows also need to be able to perform well on concrete and get up and down while in the crate.

*A representation of the kind of hog that works well for us*

There are many factors that go into selecting good breeding stock for each operation. Careful consideration is needed when choosing replacement stock and which boars to breed to. A producer is not going to learn everything in one day, so research and talking to other fellow farmers proves valuable.

## Healthy Pigs, More Money

Animal health and welfare is the most important concept in the livestock industry. A producer cannot make money on animals that are not cared for properly. Administering to the health of the pigs begins on day one, sometimes before day one, and continues through the life of the pig. 

For instance, the other day we had a gilt that had finally begun to farrow. This gilt has been in our holding pen for a few weeks to monitor and ensure she was in good condition. I was nervous because she is a smaller gilt and was unsure of the type of pigs the boar she was bred to would produce. I was afraid her pelvis would not be big enough, and she would have trouble farrowing. 

My concern was justified. 

I had gotten out of class early and was sitting down to work on some unfinished homework when my boss calls me. He asked what I had going on for the rest of the day, and if I had time to come to the farm and look at the gilt. He said that I have the most experience with the farrowing process and the smallest hands. I obliged and drove to the farm. When I got there, I quickly changed into my work clothes and went to look. She had started farrowing early that morning and so far, had one live pig and three stillborn. She was still contracting, so I thought the most likely scenario was she had a pig stuck and needed help to get it out.

I put on an OB sleeve and lubed up. I cupped my hand and gently reached into the gilt’s vulva and passed the cervix. Right at her pelvic bone, I felt a head. It was going to be a tight fit! So, I tried to grab its head to pull it out. Unfortunately, I could not get the head and my hand through the pelvis at the same time, so I had to use a special tool for pulling pigs. I guided the wire into the birthing canal and worked the wire over the pig’s head and over one leg. If you wrap the wire over the head and then try to pull the pig out, it is common for the head to pop off and this leads to more issues. I got the wire situated and while working with the gilts contractions was able to successfully pull the pig out. I quickly dried the pig off and set it next to the sow to nurse. We had to assist the gilt with a few more pigs, but otherwise everything went well, and both gilt and piglets are doing fine.

This is an example of the importance of caring for the animal health and welfare. If we had not been monitoring the gilt closely, the situation had the potential to be worse. Failure to assist in farrowing can result in the loss of an entire litter because the pigs become stressed while in the womb and die, the sow is unable to pass all of the pigs and is forced to abort the litter and mummify the piglets, or the sow or gilt can die due to stress, over-exertion, or even a heart attack. Timely responses in the farrowing process help to ensure healthy pigs which leads to better growth and vitality, resulting in more profit at market time.

## Keeping the Pigs In

All the pigs located on the CofO hog farm are raised on dirt. This means the sows are kept on pasture when they are not farrowing, and the pigs are moved to grow-out pens after they are weaned. This unusual setup presents many challenges when dealing with the weather and pig containment. 

Fencing is a conundrum faced daily. The farm was established over 50 years ago, and most of the fencing was put in at that time. Over time, the original woven wire has become worn out and we are constantly discovering holes in the fences. Heavy rains have washed away sections and created buildup of debris. Since pigs are curious creatures, they are always testing the fence. We repair the fences the best we can but have gradually begun the arduous process of replacing all the fences. The woven wire will be replaced, but this time one strand of electric wire will be added about 6 inches above the ground along the inside. The electric wire will prevent the pigs from rooting underneath the wire and rubbing on the fence, which is the primary cause of escapes. 

Housing is another factor when using a pasture setting. Each paddock has 2-3 houses that measure 8 feet square to provide shelter from the elements. Especially when loading the grow-outs, we never add more pigs than we have house space for. All the pigs should be able to comfortably fit in the houses at one time, which is approximately 10 market hogs. In the winter, straw bales are placed in the houses on a weekly basis. The straw gives the pigs a warm and dry place to lay and sleep.

*One of the many houses in a pasture*

In the summer, the houses provide additional shade. This is vital because pigs’ sunburn just like people do. If the sunburn is severe enough, the pig can develop an infection and become extremely sick. In the hot summer months, we run sprinklers to every pen of pigs. Pigs do not sweat and therefore wallow in mud to cool off.  Sprinklers help to keep the pigs cool by maintaining a section of mud.

Raising pigs on pasture closely resembles their natural habitat and eliminates a lot of overhead costs. It can be tricky to keep the pigs comfortable and contained, but the animals always seem happy and manage to perform well.

I am Chania Hoffman. Currently, I am a senior at College of the Ozarks studying Animal Science and Agricultural Business. I grew up in central Missouri on a small farm where we raise poultry, sheep, cattle and of course…. PIGS!

Raising hogs is a hobby and a way of life for me, and I am constantly striving to learn all that I can about the hog industry and its ever-changing atmosphere. I first began working with pigs through 4-H and since then, I have not been able to get away. I have grown from showing pigs at my county fair, to developing a Supervised Agricultural Experience in FFA, I started working and became a student manager at my college’s hog farm and have completed an internship at a commercial hog farm. I have learned a lot and have worked to make hog farming my way of life.

My work experience includes;
-	County Line Acres (my family farm)
-	Audrain Veterinary Clinic
-	CofO Feed mill
-	CofO Hog Farm
-	Springer Family Foods
