What I learned while doing this blog was how to organize my pictures to correspond with my text. I tried to keep the information concise and my topics interesting. Since a picture speaks a thousand words, I wanted to capitalize on that while keeping the audience intrigued.  I really wanted to share a piece of what I do and I think my pictures really helped to accentuate what I was discussing.  

A concept that I am still struggling with is how to present the information. I wanted to be informational just approachable and applicable. I have a story to tell, but struggled with how to put it on paper and keep it interesting. There are many stories that I could share about the challenges I face and amazing experiences that I have every day when working with my pigs. But I wasnâ€™t quite sure if they were interesting enough or explained what was happening. So I think that what I am trying to say is that I was unsure of how to present the information and the stories I wanted to share.
